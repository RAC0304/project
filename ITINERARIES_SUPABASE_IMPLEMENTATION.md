# Itineraries Supabase Implementation - Complete Guide

## Overview
This document describes the complete implementation of the itineraries management system with full Supabase integration, including all related tables and their relationships.

## Database Schema Relations

### Main Tables Involved:
1. **itineraries** - Main itinerary information
2. **itinerary_destinations** - Links itineraries to destinations
3. **itinerary_days** - Daily plans within an itinerary
4. **itinerary_activities** - Activities within each day
5. **destinations** - Referenced destinations

### Relationships:
- `itineraries` → `itinerary_destinations` (1:many)
- `itinerary_destinations` → `destinations` (many:1)
- `itineraries` → `itinerary_days` (1:many)
- `itinerary_days` → `itinerary_activities` (1:many)

## Implementation Features

### 1. Complete Form Management
- **Basic Information**: Title, duration, description, difficulty, best season, budget, image
- **Destinations**: Multi-select with dynamic add/remove
- **Days Management**: Add/remove days with details (accommodation, meals, transportation)
- **Activities Management**: Add/remove activities per day with time, location, description

### 2. Supabase Integration
- **Create Operation**: Inserts data into all related tables with proper foreign key relationships
- **Read Operation**: Fetches complete itinerary with all related data using joins
- **Update Operation**: Updates main itinerary and recreates related data
- **Delete Operation**: Cascading deletes in correct order to maintain referential integrity

### 3. Data Flow

#### Creating an Itinerary:
1. Insert into `itineraries` table and get the ID
2. Insert selected destinations into `itinerary_destinations` with order
3. For each day:
   - Insert into `itinerary_days` and get day ID
   - Insert activities into `itinerary_activities` with day reference

#### Fetching Itineraries:
1. Query `itineraries` table
2. Join with `itinerary_destinations` → `destinations` for destination names
3. Join with `itinerary_days` → `itinerary_activities` for complete day plans
4. Transform data into frontend-friendly format

#### Updating an Itinerary:
1. Update main `itineraries` record
2. Delete existing related records from child tables
3. Re-create all related records with new data

#### Deleting an Itinerary:
1. Delete from `itinerary_activities` (deepest child)
2. Delete from `itinerary_days`
3. Delete from `itinerary_destinations`
4. Delete from `itineraries` (parent)

## Key Components

### State Management
```typescript
// Main form data
const [formData, setFormData] = useState<Partial<Itinerary>>({...});

// Dynamic field management
const [selectedDestination, setSelectedDestination] = useState("");
const [newDay, setNewDay] = useState<Partial<ItineraryDay>>({...});
const [newActivity, setNewActivity] = useState({...});
```

### Core Functions

#### 1. Data Fetching
```typescript
const fetchItineraries = async () => {
    // Fetch itineraries with all related data
    // Transform database format to frontend format
};
```

#### 2. Form Submission
```typescript
const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
    // Validate data
    // Create/update itinerary
    // Handle related tables
    // Refresh data
};
```

#### 3. Dynamic Field Management
```typescript
const handleAddDestination = () => { /* Add destination to list */ };
const handleAddDay = () => { /* Add new day to itinerary */ };
const handleAddActivity = (dayIndex: number) => { /* Add activity to specific day */ };
```

## Form Sections

### 1. Basic Information
- Title (required)
- Duration (required)
- Description (required)
- Difficulty (dropdown)
- Best Season
- Estimated Budget
- Image URL

### 2. Destinations Section
- Dropdown to select from available destinations
- Add/Remove functionality
- Visual chips showing selected destinations

### 3. Days Section
- Add new day form with:
  - Day title (required)
  - Description (required)
  - Accommodation
  - Meals
  - Transportation
- List of existing days with:
  - Day details
  - Activities management
  - Remove day functionality

### 4. Activities Section (per day)
- Add new activity form with:
  - Time (required)
  - Title (required)
  - Description
  - Location
- List of existing activities with remove functionality

## Display Features

### Itinerary List View
- Title, duration, difficulty badges
- Description preview
- Destinations, days count, budget info
- Days preview with activity counts
- Edit/Delete actions

### Form Features
- Real-time validation
- Dynamic field management
- Loading states
- Error handling
- Success/error notifications

## Error Handling

### Database Errors
- Proper error catching and display
- Rollback on partial failures
- User-friendly error messages

### Form Validation

- Proper indexing on foreign keys
- Pagination for large datasets

### Form Management
- Minimal re-renders
- Efficient state updates
- Debounced search

## Security Considerations

### RLS (Row Level Security)
- Proper RLS policies on all tables
- User-based access control
- Admin-only operations

### Data Validation
- Server-side validation
