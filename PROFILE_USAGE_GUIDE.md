# Supabase Profile Management Implementation Guide

## Changes Made

1. Fixed duplicate exports in `profileService.ts`
2. Enhanced storage handling with automatic bucket creation
3. Implemented comprehensive error handling for Supabase storage
4. Added test scripts for verifying functionality
5. Enhanced UI with better error recovery
6. Added testing functionality in development mode

## How to Test

### Method 1: Using Test Scripts

```bash
# Install dependencies if needed
npm install dotenv @supabase/supabase-js

# Run all tests
node run-all-tests.js

# Or run individual tests
node test-storage.js
node test-profile-service.js
```

### Method 2: From the UI (Development Mode Only)

1. Login to your account in development mode
2. Navigate to your profile page
3. Click the "Test Storage" button in either:
   - Next to your profile name at the top
   - In the profile photo section

## Using the Profile Management Features

### Uploading Profile Images

1. Click the camera icon button on your profile picture
2. Select an image from your device (must be less than 5MB)
3. The image will be processed and uploaded to Supabase Storage
4. Your profile will be updated with the new image URL

### Removing Custom Profile Images

1. Click the "Remove Photo" button next to your profile image
2. Your profile will revert to the default generated avatar

### Updating Profile Information

1. Click "Edit Profile" button
2. Update your information
3. Click "Save Changes"

## Troubleshooting

### Image Upload Fails

1. Check your Supabase configuration in `.env` file
2. Ensure the avatar bucket is available or can be created
3. Check browser console for detailed error messages
4. Verify file size is under 5MB

### Storage Tests Fail

1. Check network connectivity to Supabase
2. Verify your Supabase API keys
3. Ensure your Supabase account has storage enabled
4. Check for storage permission issues

## Files to Check

If you encounter any issues, check these key files:

- `src/services/profileService.ts` - Profile management logic
- `src/utils/supabaseClient.ts` - Supabase connection and storage utilities
- `src/contexts/CustomAuthContext.tsx` - Authentication integration
- `src/pages/UserProfilePage.tsx` - UI implementation

## Next Steps

Consider implementing:

1. Image resizing before upload
2. Image cropping functionality
3. Additional profile fields as needed
4. Profile verification badges
