                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Indonesia is generally safe for tourists, particularly in popular destinations. As with any travel, exercise normal precautions, be aware of your surroundings, and respect local customs. Stay informed about specific regional conditions, especially regarding natural hazards like volcanoes or earthquakes.

                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  The Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) is the official currency. Credit cards are widely accepted in tourist areas and major cities, but carry cash for smaller establishments and rural areas. ATMs are readily available in urban centers and tourist destinations.

                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  While no mandatory vaccinations are required for entry, recommended vaccinations include Hepatitis A, Typhoid, and routine vaccines. Consider Hepatitis B, Japanese Encephalitis, and Rabies for longer stays. Consult your healthcare provider for personalized advice.

                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Due to Indonesia's size and diversity, at least 2 weeks is recommended to experience one or two regions properly. For a comprehensive tour across multiple islands, consider 3-4 weeks. Even a single island like Bali or Java deserves at least one week to explore thoroughly.

                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  English is commonly spoken in tourist areas, international hotels, and by younger Indonesians in urban centers. In rural areas, English proficiency may be limited. Learning a few basic Indonesian phrases is helpful and appreciated by locals.
