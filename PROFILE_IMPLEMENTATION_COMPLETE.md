# Profile Management Implementation Complete

## Summary

The profile management system with Supabase has been successfully implemented. This includes:

1. Profile data updates through Supabase database
2. Profile image uploads to Supabase Storage
3. Comprehensive error handling and recovery
4. Testing utilities for verification

## Features Implemented

### Profile Service

- Created singleton service for handling all profile-related operations
- Added profile update functionality with proper field mapping
- Implemented robust image upload with browser-compatible processing
- Added error handling for network, storage, and auth issues
- Added activity logging for profile changes

### Image Storage

- Implemented automatic bucket creation if not exists
- Added storage availability checking with retries
- Created reliable URL generation for profile images
- Added image type detection and proper content type handling
- Implemented error recovery for failed uploads

### User Interface

- Enhanced UI with loading indicators for async operations
- Added fallback to default avatars when images fail to load
- Implemented responsive image upload experience
- Added development mode testing tools
- Fixed circular dependency issues with dynamic imports

### Testing

- Created test scripts for storage functionality
- Added profile service test utilities
- Implemented comprehensive test coverage for image uploads
- Added error case testing for storage unavailability

## Files Modified

- `src/services/profileService.ts` - Main profile service implementation
- `src/utils/supabaseClient.ts` - Storage utilities and bucket management
- `src/contexts/CustomAuthContext.tsx` - Auth integration with profile service
- `src/pages/UserProfilePage.tsx` - UI components and image handling
- `src/types/user.ts` - Added avatar field to profile types

## Test Scripts

- `test-storage.js` - Tests basic Supabase storage functionality
- `test-profile-service.js` - Tests profile service image upload capability
- `run-all-tests.js` - Runs all tests sequentially

## Usage

To update a user profile:

```typescript
// Through the auth context
const { updateProfile } = useAuth();
await updateProfile({
  firstName: "New Name",
  avatar: "data:image/png;base64,...", // Base64 image or URL
});

// Or directly through the profile service
import { profileService } from "../services/profileService";
await profileService.updateProfile(userId, {
  firstName: "New Name",
  avatar: "data:image/png;base64,...", // Base64 image or URL
});
```

## Testing

Test scripts can be run to verify the functionality:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install dotenv @supabase/supabase-js

# Run all tests
node run-all-tests.js

# Or run individual tests
node test-storage.js
node test-profile-service.js
```

## Future Improvements

1. Add image resizing before upload to reduce storage usage
2. Implement client-side image cropping
3. Add caching mechanism for frequently accessed profile images
4. Add automatic cleanup of orphaned profile images
5. Implement rate limiting for profile updates

## Environment Requirements

Requires the following environment variables in `.env` file:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```
