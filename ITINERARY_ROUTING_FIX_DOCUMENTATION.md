# Itinerary Routing Fix - Documentation

## Problem Summary
The user was encountering errors when trying to access itinerary detail pages. The logs showed:
- URL: `/itineraries/3` (using numeric ID instead of slug)
- Error: 406 Not Acceptable from Supabase
- Issue: System was treating "3" as a slug, but no itinerary had slug "3"

## Root Cause
The itinerary detail page route is defined as `/itineraries/:slug` and expects slug-based URLs like `/itineraries/bali-escape`. However, someone was accessing the page with a numeric ID (`/itineraries/3`), which the system incorrectly interpreted as a slug.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced ItineraryDetailPage.tsx
Added intelligent fallback logic in the `loadItinerary` function:

```typescript
// First try to load by slug
let data = await getItineraryBySlug(slug);

// If not found and slug is numeric, try loading by ID
if (!data && /^\d+$/.test(slug)) {
  console.log('üîÑ Slug appears to be numeric, trying to load by ID:', slug);
  data = await getItineraryById(slug);
  
  // If found by ID, redirect to the correct slug URL
  if (data) {
    console.log('‚úÖ Found by ID, redirecting to slug URL:', data.slug);
    navigate(`/itineraries/${data.slug}`, { replace: true });
    return;
  }
}
```

### 2. Improved getItineraryById Service
Enhanced the service function with better error handling and logging:

```typescript
// Convert string ID to number for the query
const numericId = parseInt(id, 10);
if (isNaN(numericId)) {
  console.log('‚ùå Invalid ID format:', id);
  return null;
}
```

### 3. Behavior Flow
1. User visits `/itineraries/3`
2. System extracts slug parameter: "3"
3. Tries `getItineraryBySlug("3")` ‚Üí fails (no slug "3" exists)
4. Detects that "3" is numeric using regex `/^\d+$/`
5. Tries `getItineraryById("3")` ‚Üí succeeds (finds itinerary with ID 3)
6. Redirects to correct URL: `/itineraries/bali-escape`
7. Page loads normally with proper slug-based URL

## Benefits
1. **Backward Compatibility**: Old ID-based URLs still work via redirect
2. **SEO Friendly**: All final URLs use proper slugs
3. **User Experience**: No broken links or 404 errors
4. **Future Proof**: All new links use slugs, legacy links are handled gracefully

## Components Verified
- ‚úÖ `ItineraryCard`: Uses `to={`/itineraries/${itinerary.slug}`}`
- ‚úÖ `HomePage`: Uses ItineraryCard component correctly
- ‚úÖ `ItinerariesPage`: Uses ItineraryCard component correctly
- ‚úÖ Router: Defined as `/itineraries/:slug`

## Testing
Test cases to verify the fix:
1. `/itineraries/bali-escape` ‚Üí loads directly ‚úÖ
2. `/itineraries/3` ‚Üí redirects to `/itineraries/bali-escape` ‚úÖ
3. `/itineraries/invalid-slug` ‚Üí shows Not Found page ‚úÖ
4. `/itineraries/999` ‚Üí shows Not Found page (no ID 999) ‚úÖ

## Files Modified
- `src/pages/ItineraryDetailPage.tsx` - Added fallback logic and redirect
- `src/services/itineraryService.ts` - Enhanced getItineraryById with better error handling

## No Breaking Changes
- All existing slug-based URLs continue to work normally
- All existing components and links remain unchanged
- Only adds graceful handling for edge cases

The fix ensures robust itinerary routing while maintaining clean, SEO-friendly URLs.
